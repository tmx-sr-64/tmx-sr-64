ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @tmx-sr-64
   One of my main interests is the Open Source Ecosystem (OSE) and related initiatives that were created and launched by the Solid State Circuits Society of the IEEE. 
   Iâ€™m currently learning the practical nuts and bolts of that to develop general know how in the design flow methods, chip design techniques and limitations on a OSE platform. 
   
   The core objective is to acquire and/or maintain competence in some aspects of electrical engineering that I am very interested in but dont always get the opportunity to delve into 
   whilst on long-term contract in another engineering domain, and where I am heavily restricted to using the proprietary EDA tool environment of a business partner under license.  
   I also hope to leverage the OSE for continued learning, knowledge review and technical competence development whilst not engaged in a contract of work with a business partner.
